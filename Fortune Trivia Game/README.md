**The main files in the repository are:**

MainFortune.java: The entry point of the game where the game is initialized and played.  
QuestionFortune.java: Defines the structure for each question, including the hint, answer, and category.  
FortuneGame.java: Handles the game logic, including randomly selecting questions and managing the player's score.  


**How the Game Works**

Game Setup: The game initializes a list of QuestionFortune objects, each containing a hint, answer, and category.  
Randomization: At the start of each round, the game randomly selects a category and presents a question from that category.  
Player Interaction: The player is prompted to guess the answer to the question.  
Feedback: The game provides feedback, such as whether the guess was correct or not, and continues until all rounds are completed.  

**If you'd like to customize the game, you can:**

Add more categories: You can add new question categories to the game by adding new QuestionFortune objects with different hints and answers.  
Adjust game settings: Modify the game logic in the FortuneGame class to change the number of rounds, question types, or difficulty.  
Adding New Categories:  
To add a new category, simply create a new QuestionFortune object with the following format:  

new QuestionFortune("Your hint", "Your answer", "Your category");  

For example:  
new QuestionFortune("A country known for its pyramids and ancient civilization.", "EGYPT", "Country");  

**To change the number of rounds or difficulty, modify the FortuneGame class:**  

FortuneGame game = new FortuneGame(questions, 3, 10, 0, "Phrase");  
The first number 3 represents the number of rounds.  
The second number 10 represents the time limit (you can modify this as needed).  
"Phrase" is the default category, which can be adjusted.
