# Leon's Programming Portfolio

<hr>

Hello, my name is Leon Aaron and I am a highly motivated Computer Science student at UNC Chapel Hill. Participating in my middle schoolâ€™s robotics club as a 6th grader was an experience that sparked my creative passion for coding. Since then, I have gained proficeincy in both Java and Python and have constructed interesting programming projects to reinforce my computer science skills. I am a hard worker who strives for high-quality results and prioritizes clean, organized code.

This repository contains a collection of programming projects that were created as a way to improve my computer science skill.

Feel free to explore the scripts and use them for your learning and automation needs!

## List of Scripts:

1. [batch_file_rename.py](https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python/blob/master/batch_file_rename.py) - Batch rename a group of files in a specified directory, changing their extensions.
2. [create_dir_if_not_there.py](https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python/blob/master/create_dir_if_not_there.py) - Check if a directory exists in the user's home directory. Create it if it doesn't exist.
3. [Fast Youtube Downloader](https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python/blob/master/youtubedownloader.py) - Download YouTube videos quickly with parallel threads using aria2c.
